# Strategic Volunteer Placement

Background:
An analytics firm is approached by a non-profit advocacy organization for women to be greater represented in the tech industry. Every year, they hold a gala to bring awareness to their cause. The organization wants to maximize the amount attendees that attend the gala this year and request the help of the firm.

This Project uses [data from subway turnstiles](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) provided by the [Metropolitan Transportation Authority](www.mta.info) of New York.

## Project Goal:

**Use the turnstile data to recommend around which subway stations volunteers should be distributed to maximize the number of attendees to this year's gala.**

#### Assumptions: 

We want to maximize the number of ‘unique encounters with people who have availability to chat’. We don’t have an unlimited supply of volunteer-man-hours. People are busy in the mornings and in a rush, but may have more time in the late afternoon/evenings.

### Problem Statement:

We will focus on identifying stations with the most entries between the hours of 3-7pm. 


## Notebook Information
The [Project Benson Challenges Notebook](Project_Benson_Challenges.ipynb) is a series of steps taken to answer different questions about the project.


Note: This project was a one-week hands-on-experience exercise in becoming proficient with the Python pandas library as this would be a basic tool for introductory data exploration going forward in the bootcamp. It's nostalgic to look back on this code, at the panic I experienced when working with dataframes for the first time, and marvel at how far I've come as a programmer since then.
