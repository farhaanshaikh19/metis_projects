### <a name="section-a"></a>[1. Strategic Volunteer Placement](01-Strategic_Volunteer_Placement/)

Background:
An analytics firm is approached by a non-profit advocacy organization for women to be greater represented in the tech industry. Every year, they hold a gala to bring awareness to their cause. The organization wants to maximize the amount attendees that attend the gala this year and request the help of the firm.

This Project uses [data from subway turnstiles](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) provided by the [Metropolitan Transportation Authority](www.mta.info) of New York.

The goal of this project was to use the turnstile data to recommend around which subway stations volunteers should be distributed to maximize the number of attendees to this years gala.

Note: This project was a one-week hands-on-experience exercise in becoming proficient with the Python pandas library as this would be a basic tool for introductory data exploration going forward in the bootcamp.
